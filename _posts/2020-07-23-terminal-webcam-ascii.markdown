It's lockdown and I'm working on a project that involves video chat functionality and I have been working with OpenCV. Whilst playing around with OpenCV I wondered how we could use webcams if GUIs did not exist, the idea of turning webcam feed into ASCII came into mind. I choose Python over C as the OpenCV-Python libraries are wonderful and easier to implement. I'm planning to extend this program to allow live video chat and fix the efficiency.
