<h2> Hello World!</h2>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate at Monash University(South Africa), pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer and Information Science, with a double major in Software Development and Computer Network security. My interest lies in code and languages that run behind the scenes powering web services, and testing vulnerabilities in applications(mainly through CTF challenges and bug bounty platforms.)</p>

<p>I am interested in participating in CTF challenges and sharing interesting findings, on my blog. It's hard to find these events within my area so I participate mainly on the Hacker101 CTF, with some private invitations.</p>
